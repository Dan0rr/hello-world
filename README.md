# hello-world

My name is Daniel Orr, you can call me Dan.

This is my first repository and first time on GitHub.

I am currently learning to code HTML5, CSS, SCSS, JAVAScript, React, and hopefully NodeJS. 
I currently work as a Design Engineer at a consultant company in the automotive sector. I am pursuing coding due to the freedoms the field has to offer. 
I still enjoy talking about cars and the mechanical aspects of life but im excited for what the coding world has to offer.
